                    <p>pigeon facts
                        <br>Although harmless, they can be quite a nuisance when food is around.
                        <br> Pigeons, in their natural habitat, or home, live near rocky cliffs.
                        <br> In this environment, the pigeons will build their nests high on the cliffs, making it challenging for predators to reach them or their eggs.
